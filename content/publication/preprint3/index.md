abstract: Fused deposition modeling provides an effective means for complex molding of Fe–Si–Al bonded magnets, but the fused deposition molding of Fe–Si–Al bonded magnets with high magnetic powder content is still a challenge. In this work, we used a miniature single screw as a print head to study the magnetic properties, mechanical properties and microstructure properties of Fe–Si–Al bonded magnets with different magnetic powders content. Compared with the molded samples made of the same raw material, the overall performance of the bonded magnet is the best. The Fe–Si–Al bonded magnets show a saturation magnetization of 123 emu/g and an ultimate tensile strength of 11.2 MPa. Moreover, its performance is equivalent to that of the compressed sample with the same magnetic powder content when the magnetic powder content is 94 wt%. This research provides a method for the composite molding of Fe–Si–Al bonded magnets with high magnetic powder content and lays a technical foundation for the application of Fe–Si–Al bonded magnets.
