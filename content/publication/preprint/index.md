abstract: Perovskite-type oxide nanocrystals (AxByOz) have attracted increasing interest as efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts, which possess distinct thermal stability, ionic conductivity and electron mobility properties. Particularly, the electronic structure of perovskite-type nanocrystal plays a decisive role in electrocatalytic performance. Here, we systematically investigate the eg orbital filling, metal-oxygen hybridization, and electron correlations of perovskite-type oxide nanocrystals for high-performance OER catalysis. Meanwhile, the construction strategies for controlling the atomic configurations of adjacent sites and coordination environments in perovskite-type catalysts are also discussed for the rational design of efficient OER catalysts. Notably, we build a bridge between coordination environments, electronic structures, and catalytic activity of catalysts by focusing on the physicochemical properties of catalysts in terms of atom replacement, atom doping, and oxygen vacancy. This work would provide the readers with a comprehensive understanding and updated information towards the design of perovskite-type oxide nanocrystals with well-confined electronic properties for electrocatalysis. Finally, a perspective is given on the opportunities and further research directions of perovskite-based electrocatalysts for OER as well as the challenges involved in this task.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: A review on electrocatalysts optimized with perovskite-type oxide nanocrystals for oxygen evolution reaction (OER).
